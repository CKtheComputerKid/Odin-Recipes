    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sanitize your equipment: pot, jug, funnel, airlocks, spoon, etc. Follow the directions on the sanitizer package.</li>
        <li>Heat .5 gallon of non-chlorinated water in the large pot on medium heat, do not boil. Add the honey and stir until it fully dissolves. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Add your chosen fruits and spices to the one-gallon jug.</li>
        <li>Using a funnel, pour the honey-water mixture into the one-gallon jug.</li>
        <li>Leave atleast 2 inches of headspace at the top. Add additional cold non-chlorinated water if needed.</li>
        <li>Secure the lid and shake well.</li>
        <li><h5>When the temperature drops below 90 degrees F</h5>, add .5 of the yeast pack.</li>
        <li>Cap the bottle and give it a gentle shake to mix the yeast.</li>
        <li>Place the airlock on the jar, add a little water to the line, and then put the rubber stopper end into the jug.</li>
        <li>Wou should see bubbles within the first 48 hours.</li>
        <li>Store the jug in a dark cool place, or cover with with a towel. It will take 4 - 6 weeks for fermentation.</li>
        <li>It is ready when the bubbling has stopped or slowed to once every minute instead of every few seconds as it was initially.</li>
        <li>The liquid will be clear, and the yeast will settle to the jug's bottom.</li>
        <li>Do a taste test. Use a clean straw for tasting but be careful not to backwash into the mead.</li>
        <li>If you like the flavor, it is ready to bottle the mead.</li>
        <li>If it is too dry and you prefer a little sweeter, you can back-sweeten it. This is an additional process outside the scope of this recipe though.</li>
    </ol>
